Gmail Style Squeeze for Chrome
==============================

This extension makes minor changes to the Gmailâ„¢ interface, "squeezing" elements to use less screen estate, and making certain elements stand out.  Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/style-squeeze-for-gmail/halnhfmadppofimclpahinbnjihhbddn).

### Description

The primary intention was to make 'Compact' view even more compact, especially in the sidebar, toolbar buttons, and message list and view areas.  This extension makes labels, toolbar buttons, scrollbars, message headers take up less space.  It also makes certain elements stand out visually, like giving message headers a blue background, and framing inline message context messages (i.e. "click to display images") in pale yellow.

Gmail has been changing often, but hopefully this extension will continue to work for while!  These styles were tested using:

 - "Compact" view mode
 - both horizontal and vertical splits
 - "Light", "High Contrast", and various color themes

### Known Bugs
